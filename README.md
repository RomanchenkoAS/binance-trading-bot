Objectives:

Scrape historical candlestick data from Binance exchange
Backtest a specific strategy against historical data and show a heatmap for a range of coefficients
Create a bot that trades on Binance testnet using a chosen strategy and records its actions to a CSV and log file
Analyze trades and show a dataframe and returns of the trading strategy
Goals:

Develop and test additional strategies to improve bot performance
Implement the bot on the live Binance exchange and track its performance
Use machine learning techniques to optimize strategy coefficients and parameters
Build a front-end interface to visualize bot performance and trading activity
Regarding your code, I have some suggestions for improvement and modifications that could help make your project more robust and efficient:

Data scraping:
Consider using the Binance API instead of web scraping to access historical data. This would likely be faster and more reliable.
Add error handling for failed requests or missing data.
Backtesting:
Consider using a more diverse set of metrics to evaluate strategy performance, such as Sharpe ratio or maximum drawdown.
Implement additional technical indicators to use in strategy development.
Bot:
Implement error handling for failed trades or other unexpected events.
Add support for different assets and trading pairs.
Consider implementing stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk.
Analysis:
Explore more advanced analysis techniques such as time series forecasting or sentiment analysis to improve trading strategy.
